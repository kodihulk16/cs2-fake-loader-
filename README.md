# CS2 Fake Loader (Prank Project)

This is a harmless parody project designed to *look* like a CS2 external loader, but it is actually just a fun prank.  
When launched, it displays a fullscreen trollface image and plays a sound effect.  
It does **not** modify CS2, interact with the game, or provide cheats of any kind.

This project is purely for entertainment and learning.
